How to run the programs mentioned in "Styles Make Fights: Past Plays as a Predictor of Future Plays":
-
  1) predict_plays.py takes no arguments. To run this program, enter <python3 predict_plays.py> in terminal or run the file in      Idle or a notebook. The program outputs four values, each printed in a sentence for clarity. The program does not create      any new files. The report (and comments in the code) further explain what these numbers represent. To run using different      years, change the value of oldfile and newfile (file names are listed above these lines of code)
  2) plays_anova.py takes no arguments. To run this program, enter <python3 plays_anova.py> in terminal or run the file in          Idle or a notebook. This program uses lists of values that were generated in predict_plays.py and then manually inputted      into this file. The program outputs normality scores, the results of an Anova test, and the results of a Tukey HSD test.      The program does not create any new files. You may find that running this program helps you follow along with the section      of the report where the program is discussed.
